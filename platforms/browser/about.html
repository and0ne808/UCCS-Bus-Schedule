<h1>About This App</h1>
<p>This app was created by Andrew Day, a UCCS student. His website is <a href="http://aday.us">aday.us</a>. You can email him at andrew@aday.us.</p>
	
	<p>I wanted to make a UCCS bus schedlue app because I would occasionally neglect to bring a copy of the bus
	schedule with me. Now I always have the schedule! I hope you enjoy! -Andrew</p>
	
	<p>This is a completely free and open source project. Developers, Can you make this app better? <a href="https://github.com/and0ne808/UCCS-Bus-Schedule/">Source code is available on GitHub.</a></p>
